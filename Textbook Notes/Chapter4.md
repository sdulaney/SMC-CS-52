CHAPTER 4: PROCEDURAL ABSTRACTION AND FUNCTIONS THAT RETURN A VALUE

- 4.1 Top-Down Design
  - Top-down design is a method in which you break down the task to be accomplished into a few subtasks, decompose each of these subtasks into smaller subtasks, and eventually the subtasks become so small that they are trivial to implement in C++
- 4.2 Predefined Functions
  - Using Predefined Functions
    - The value the function starts out with is called its argument
    - The  value it computes is called the value returned
    - A function call or invocation is an expression consisting of the function name followed by arguments enclosed in parentheses
    - Include directives specify the name of a file known as a header file for a given library
    - Include directives are processed by the preprocessor
    - Some predefined functions from `#include <cmath>`: sqrt, pow, fabs, ceil, floor
    - Some predefined functions from `#include <cstdlib>`: abs, labs, srand, rand
  - Random Number Generation
  - Type Casting
  - Older Form of Type Casting
  - Pitfall: Integer Division Drops the Fractional Part
- 4.3 Programmer-Defined Functions
  - Function Definitions
  - Functions That Return a Boolean Value
  - Alternate Form for Function Declarations
  - Pitfall: Arguments in the Wrong Order
  - Function Definitionâ€” Syntax Summary
  - More About Placement of Function Definitions
  - Programming Tip: Use Function Calls in Branching Statements
- 4.4 Procedural Abstraction
  - The Black-Box Analogy
  - Programming Tip: Choosing Formal Parameter Names
  - Programming Tip: Nested Loops
  - Case Study: Buying Pizza
  - Programming Tip: Use Pseudocode
- 4.5 Scope and Local Variables
  - The Small Program Analogy
  - Programming Example: Experimental Pea Patch
  - Global Constants and Global Variables
  - Call-by-Value Formal Parameters Are Local Variables
  - Block Scope
  - Namespaces Revisited
  - Programming Example: The Factorial Function
- 4.6 Overloading and Function Names
  - Introduction to Overloading
  - Programming Example: Revised Pizza-Buying Program
  - Automatic Type Conversion
